# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Background

For this ETL mini project, Niti Patel and Brandon Reed worked together to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

Specifically, the project contained the following components, with Niti and Brandon owning specific components:
1. Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames (Niti)
2. Create the Campaign DataFrame (Brandon)
3. Create the Contacts DataFrame (Niti)
4. Create the Crowdfunding Database (Brandon)

## Directions
- Open the Starter Files folder to access the final Jupyter Notebook code for steps 1-3 above. 
- Open the "crowdfunding_db_schema" to access the PostgreSQL code for step 4 above. 
- The Resources folder contains the original xlsm data files as well as the four CSV files created in steps 1-3. 
- As reference, the archive folder contains Niti and Brandon's working Jupyter Notebooks.
